# TDS Project



## 1. Exlanation of how I scraped the data 🧑‍🏫

Used the GitHub API to find Chicago-based users with over 100 followers, saving profile links in `users.txt` so that I have a consolidated list of users. Retrieved detailed profile data for these users and saved it in a cleaned format in users.csv. Fetched up to 500 recent repositories per user, storing key details in repositories.csv.


## 2. The most interesting and surprising fact I found after analyzing the data 📊
The most surprising fact I found after analyzing the data was that 85% of the total users had a wiki, which was unexpected because I thought a lot of people don't maintain a wiki.

## 3. An actionable recommendation for developers based on my analysis 🦾
Based on my analysis, I recommend maintaining a higher number of meaningful public repositories, as successful developers average 110 compared to 90 for others. Additionally, focus on high-impact programming languages, with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Shell being the most prevalent among successful developers.
